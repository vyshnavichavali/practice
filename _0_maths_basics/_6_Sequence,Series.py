REQ: Find the expression output: 2x*x+3x+1 when x = 10?
   As given x = 10
   Substitute value x in expresssion i.e.,
   = 2(10)(10) + 3 (10) + 1
   = 2(100) + 30 + 1
   = 200 + 30 + 1
   = 231

# STATE    : x = 10
# BEHAVIOR : 2xx+3x+1

Without State, we can't get Behavior.
To get Behavior, State is mandatory.
